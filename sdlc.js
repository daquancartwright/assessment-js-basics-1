// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis = "The phase where the team analyzes the planning of the app."

const design = "The phase that creates a high-level system design based on the requirements. Can be represented using diagrams, such as flowcharts."

const implementation = "This phase is where the software design is translated into code."

const testing = "Phase where the testing team evaluates the developed product(s) in order to assess whether they meet the requirements specified in the planning phase."

const maintain = "The phase that involves monitoring and supporting the sorftware in the production environment."
